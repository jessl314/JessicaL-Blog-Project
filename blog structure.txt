blog structure

front page something pretty??? this could be the general about me, elevator pitch also description of tabs
we are going to need to wireframe this, probs need a picture of me on there, like my linkedin pic 



tabs:

blog: as in I can actually create posts

resources: easiest, link resume, GitHub, maybe my hackathon and vgdc links (probably venushacks and pitch project, not zotjam or zothacks...), linkedin, Instagram, idk. sort of like a link tree lol


fun stuff about me???? like idk my hobbies, a list of my favorite tv shows etc.


Navbar
- use Bootstrap Navbar + React Routes
Bootstrap: Handles the visual design and helps users switch between menu items (links).
React Router: Handles the functional sideâ€”it determines which component to render when a user clicks on a menu item, enabling dynamic updates to the view.

for the projects: I think we will have a Projects tab which when hovered over will be a dropdown menu from which we can specify Speepy and Grin project

for grin, I think it'll be more about the learning experience vs what I actually contributed (nothing) lol. I also will not link the actual repository since it would have to be public ( no trouble for me!!!). instead I will have screenshots I think and then explain like oh I learned clases, overloaded functions idk. then after Neet or whoever looks at it I will remove the route and tab. for video game project I can then include the itch link, a demo video maybe, unity screen shots, talk about what I learned about github, collaborating with non-technical people etc.
after neet looks at it I think I can replace the grin program with the blog project, focusing more on my experience coding my portfolio what I learned etc. instead of you know the actual blog.  this could be good for the future just so people can see the extent of my learning and passion to self-learn hehe
