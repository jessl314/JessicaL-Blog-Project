blog structure

front page something pretty??? this could be the general about me, elevator pitch also description of tabs
we are going to need to wireframe this, probs need a picture of me on there, like my linkedin pic 



tabs:

blog: as in I can actually create posts

resources: easiest, link resume, GitHub, maybe my hackathon and vgdc links (probably venushacks and pitch project, not zotjam or zothacks...), linkedin, Instagram, idk. sort of like a link tree lol


fun stuff about me???? like idk my hobbies, a list of my favorite tv shows etc.


Navbar
- use Bootstrap Navbar + React Routes
Bootstrap: Handles the visual design and helps users switch between menu items (links).
React Router: Handles the functional sideâ€”it determines which component to render when a user clicks on a menu item, enabling dynamic updates to the view.
