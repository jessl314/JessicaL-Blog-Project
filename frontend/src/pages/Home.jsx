        <p>Hello World! Welcome to my personal portfolio website! Looking around you'll learn a bit more about me and some projects that I'm proud of. </p>
        <p> Wonder why I have a page with a cat image generator? This website is my first ever personal project! Since I wanted some experience using API's and Express.js I chose to use a simple API to display something that I like a lot, cats!</p>
